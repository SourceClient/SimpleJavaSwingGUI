# Java Swing GUI
- Credits:
- Tux: for the gradle system on his GitHub repository <3 https://github.com/Tux8068/InstallerForJava (his is a lot better i'd recomend if you dont want to waste your time)


- Note:
- This is my first time making a GUI so this is a really bad design but i did over like 40 commits as of 2022-01-29, and I really want to take a break but I got nothing to do lol
- Might learn JavaFX
