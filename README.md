# Java Swing GUI
- Credits:
- Tux: for the gradle system on his GitHub repository <3 https://github.com/Tux8068/InstallerForJava (his is a lot better i'd recomend if you dont want to waste your time)


- Note:
- This is my first serious project, this is my first time making a Swing GUI so there might be some issues if you try and use it. You can DM me on discord if 
you have any problems. Two#6969
